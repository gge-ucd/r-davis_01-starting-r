 > *There was a young lady named Bright,*

 > *And returned on the previous night.* (A. H. Reginald Buller, 1923)

 - This is a **REPO**sitory
 - This **README** should tell us what is in the **repo**sitory, and what the repo is for.
 - You can add README files for every folder or directory within your repository. Keep them as `.md` files and they will render as webpages on Github (so don't push the `.html` version).
